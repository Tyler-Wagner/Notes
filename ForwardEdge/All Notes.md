		- Needed a baseline for what the packets looked like and where the data is so I can find an entry point for breaking confidentiality
		- Coded a python3 server on message2 and a client on message1
			- Sends packets where I **KNOW** the message being sent
			- This allowed me to see where the data is stored within the packet
			- Now I can start the server up on my machine and see if I can intercept the packets or break its encryption
			- I know the byte it starts at so *MAYBE* I can ignore everything outside of those packets and decode that and see what I come up with
- **General**
	- Client IP = 192.168.0.2
	- Hub IP = 192.168.0.1
	- The hub sends a 112 length packet to the client 1 minute prior to receiving a new key
- **RECON**
	- 
- **ATTACKS**
	- ==DOS==
		- When you the 112 length packet is received wait 45 - 50 seconds then perform DOS attack
		- Should mess up the key exchange and might not allow a key to come through
	- ==Key Manipulation==
		- 
- **ENCRYPTION**
	- The minimum number of characters in a message before it stops padding is 18
		- Padding is the same exact bunch of characters for each key
		- Since padding is the same the encryption COULD be broken that way
- **HOW KEY MANIPULATION IS BUILT**
	- Starting with a basic client and server file to send packets via the local host
		- Got that to work, stored in Tools folder
	- Starting a TCP chat client between a server and client
		- Got it to work on a local host
		- Got it working over a network
