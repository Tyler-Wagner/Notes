- **5/13/24**
	- Started to check and see if all the normal vulnerabilities are still there
		- Ports that have been open are still open
		- Same password for SSH
			- Meaning the timeout has not been changed
		- Same packages still installed that shouldn't be there, read earlier reports
		- Found that the web interfaces that were disabled are now re-enabled on Hub
			- Terminal
			- Logs
			- PFED
	- Tabs on websites tell you what files you are directly communicating with
		- Going to attempt to exploit this later on
	- Initial findings on how the boards work are still being discussed.
		- New idea is as follows
			- Inner
				- incoming layer 3 packets
				- Could strip them down to layer 2 packets
					- unsure of this
				- Sends layer 2 packets to the outer board to be routed to the frontend
				- In/Out from EUD is Ethernet
				- In/Out from Outer is a micro-usb serial cable
			- Outer
				- Acts as a switch
				- Could have encryption there
				- Specifically deals with layer 2 packets
				- Sends packets where they need to go
				- In/Out from Inner is a micro-usb serial cable
			- Frontend
				- Constructs layer 3 packet to be sent over the network
				- Sends packets to the Outer board
				- In/Out from Outer is a ethernet cable
				- In/Out from Outside network is a micro-usb to ethernet cable
	- Web Terminal
		- Bash exploit from previous findings is still a thing
			- For the love of god fix this, it is a simple config
		- Login page is /bin/login
		- Everything is transmitted back to the user in plain text
	- Firewall
		- Logs are in /var/log/iptables.log
	- PFED
		- Stored in /home/worker-2/status.log
	- Noticed an issue with the client board where you cannot login or access it unless you do so from its subnet.
		- Ie Client IP = 192.168.0.2
			- User IP has to lie within the 0.0-255 subnet
	- The boards have the tmux package installed
	- Logs do not show who is connecting to the boards at all
	- DHCP works, however the boards cannot communicate after being configured with DHCP.
- **5/14/24**
	- Searched through vulnerabilities
		- Ubuntu Version
			- Everything seems to have been patched by the package authors
		- Nginx
			- No entry points here
		- PHP
			- No entry points here
	- Reverting back to stopping communications all together
	- ==Boards==
		- If you shut down the NID via *sudo shutdown -h now* the NID does not have a way to turn itself back on, much less the board turning the NID back on
	- ==Web Service==
		- You can factory reset the things with a basic intruder command
- **5/15/24**
	- IP Spoofing
		- Can disrupt the communication, infact you can even intercept the communication between the two boards as which ever IP you are *NOT* spoofing you can intercept traffic from
			- Ping the board you are not connected to, it will talk to you for X amount of time
- **5/17/24**
	- Digging further into how the NID and the Inner boards communicate with eachother
		- Protocol in use is 0x876d
			- Linked to CISCO's ISL protocol
			- Used for interconnecting multiple switches and maintaining VLAN information
		- They are using VLANS to send the frames back and forth
			- Are they tagging the frames since they are *TECHNICALLY* leaving the VLAN on the single chip
				- If they are then there are more headers that we need to deal with at some point
				- If there is a header then it is a 26 byte header which contains a 10-bit VLAN ID
					- Only added when the frame is destined for a non local network
		- ISL protocol explains how they are able to advertise a zero lag and basically unlimited throughput on their end
	- When looking to see if the 8021q module is loaded the returned items were as follows
		- 8021q
			- Garp is being used by this
			- mrp is being used by this
		- GARP is Gratuitous ARP
			- Used to check for unused IP Addresses and automatically unassigns IP addresses
		- MRP is the media redundancy protocol which is used to offload the HW transition of MRP_Test frames
		- Obviously these are also being used by others HOWEVER they all have to do with layer 2 networking stuff
	- Many MAC addresses being handed out in wireshark that just dont make sense, need to know what they are.
		- Lanoptics
		- DiamondMulti
		- CentillioNe
- **5/20/24**
	- Starting to get more questions as we go further down the layer 2 rabbit hole
		- Are MAC addresses hard coded into the switches?
			- If so what is the MAC table storage on the switches
		- How do the VLANS work
			- What are the input IP and output IP
	- We are dealing with 2 "unmanaged", transparent switches
		- Can also physically connect to it but that is out of scope
	- Looking into the insallPFED.sh script
		- Both inner and outer boards have wifi, bt and IPV6 disabled 
			- Done on install
		- Inner and Outer both also have "custom" interfaces
			- Not sure how custom they are but the install script makes them look custom
		- Only worker 2 is being used
		- eth0 is the internal interface to outer-INE
- **5/21/24**
	- Can still login to reset and logs
		- tells you to use gui and logs you out but you can still access them which could lead to something.
	- Devices are vulnerable to terrapin attack
