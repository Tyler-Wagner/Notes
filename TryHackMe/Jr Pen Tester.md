- ==Passive Reconnaissance==
	- We use *whois* to query WHOIS records, while we use *nslookup* and *dig* to query DNS database records.
		- The records are publicly available records which means they do not alert the target
	- Will also learn the use of two online services
		- DNSDumpster
		- Shodan.io
	- These two services allow the user to collect information about the target without directly connecting to it
- ==Passive vs Active Recon==
	- Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance;
		- Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server
		- Checking job ads related to the target website
		- Reading new articles about the target company
	- Active reconnaissance cannot be achieved so discreetly.
		- Requires direct engagement with the target.
		- Examples of active recon include:
			- Connecting to a company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP
			- Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering)
			- Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman
	- Active recon can also get you into legal trouble quickly
- ==Whois==
	- is a request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification.
	- The server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests.
	- Domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names and leasing's
		- Registrar:
			- Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
		- Contact info of the registrant: 
			- Name, organization, address, phone, among other things
		- Name Server: 
			- which server was asked to resolve the domain name
	- To get this information, we need to use a whois client or an online service
- ==nslookup and dig==
	- Previously we were able to get the DNS server from the registrar
	- Find the IP address of a domain name using nslookup
		- Stands for name server look up
	- Issue the command *nslookup <domain_name>*
- ==DNSDumpster==
	- DNS lookup tools, such as nslookup and dig, cannot find subdomains on their own.
	- The domain you are inspecting might include a different subdomain that can reveal much information about the target.
	- We can consider using multiple search engines to compile a list of publicly known subdomains.
	- One search engine won't be enough; moreover, we should expect to go through atleast tens of results to find interesting data.
	- To avoid such a time consuming search, we can use an online service that offers detailed answers to DNS queries, such as DNSDumpter.
