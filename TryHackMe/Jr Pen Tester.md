- **Passive Reconnaissance**
	- ==Intro==
		- We use *whois* to query WHOIS records, while we use *nslookup* and *dig* to query DNS database records.
			- The records are publicly available records which means they do not alert the target
		- Will also learn the use of two online services
			- DNSDumpster
			- Shodan.io
		- These two services allow the user to collect information about the target without directly connecting to it
	- ==Passive vs Active Recon==
		- Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, for instance;
			- Looking up DNS records of a domain from a public DNS server
			- Checking job ads related to the target website
			- Reading new articles about the target company
		- Active reconnaissance cannot be achieved so discreetly.
			- Requires direct engagement with the target.
			- Examples of active recon include:
				- Connecting to a company servers such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP
				- Calling the company in an attempt to get information (social engineering)
				- Entering company premises pretending to be a repairman
		- Active recon can also get you into legal trouble quickly
	- ==Whois==
		- is a request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification.
		- The server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests.
		- Domain registrar is responsible for maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names and leasing's
			- Registrar:
				- Via which registrar was the domain name registered?
			- Contact info of the registrant: 
				- Name, organization, address, phone, among other things
			- Name Server: 
				- which server was asked to resolve the domain name
		- To get this information, we need to use a whois client or an online service
	- ==nslookup and dig==
		- Previously we were able to get the DNS server from the registrar
		- Find the IP address of a domain name using nslookup
			- Stands for name server look up
		- Issue the command *nslookup <domain_name>*
	- ==DNSDumpster==
		- DNS lookup tools, such as nslookup and dig, cannot find subdomains on their own.
		- The domain you are inspecting might include a different subdomain that can reveal much information about the target.
		- We can consider using multiple search engines to compile a list of publicly known subdomains.
		- One search engine won't be enough; moreover, we should expect to go through atleast tens of results to find interesting data.
		- To avoid such a time consuming search, we can use an online service that offers detailed answers to DNS queries, such as DNSDumpter.
	- ==Shodan.io==
		- Can be helpful to learn various pieces of information about the client's network, without actively connecting to it
		- Can be used to learn about connected and exposed devices belonging to your organization
		- Tries to connect to every device reachable online to build a search engine of connected "things" in contrast with a search engine for webpages.
- **Active Reconnaissance**
	- ==Intro==
		- Focusing on active reconnaissance and the essentials tools related to it.
		- Passive reconnaissance lets you gather information about your target without any kind of direct engagement or connection.
		- Active reconnaissance requires you to make some kind of contact with your target
			- This contact can be a phone call or visit to the target company.
			- Can also be a direct connection to the target system
		- Think of Active recon as you are closely inspecting windows and door locks
		- Essential to remember not to engage in active reconnaissance work before getting signed legal authorization from the client.
	- ==Web Browser==
		- can be a coinvent tool, especially that is is readily available on all systems
		- Several ways where you can use a web browser to gather information about a target
		- On the transport level the browser connects to
			- TCP port 80 by default when the website is HTTP
			- TCP port 443 by default when the website is HTTPS
		- Since 80 and 443 are common ports they are not seen in the browser, however it is possible to use custom ports to access a service. 
		- While browsing a web page you can press Ctrl+Shift+I on a PC to open the Developer tools on Firefox.
		- There are also many plugins to firefox and chrome that help with pen testing
			- FroxyProxy
				- Allows you to change the proxy server you are using to access the target website, helps when you are using BurpSuite
			- User-Agent Switcher and Manager
				- Gives you the ability to pretend to be accessing the webpage from a different operating system or different web browser 
			- Wappalyzer
				- Provides insights about the technologies used on the visited websites
	- ==Ping==
		- Should remind you of the game ping pong
		-  Primary purpose of ping is to check whether you can reach the remote system and that the remote system can reach you back.
		- Initially this was used to check the network connectivity; however we are more interested in its different uses
		- In simple terms ping commands sends a packet to a remote system, and the remote system replies
		- Picker definition: The ping is a command that sends an ICMP Echo packer to a remote system. If the remote system is online, and the ping packet was correctly routed and not blocked by any firewall, the remote system should send back and ICMP Echo Reply.
		- Objective of ping is to ensure that the target system is online before we spend time carrying out more detailed scans to discover the running operating system and services
		- ICMP = Internet Control Message Protocol
			- Supports many different types of queries, but, in particular, we are intrested in ping and ping reply
	- ==Traceroute==
		- the traceroute command traces the route taken by the packets from your system to another host.
		- The purpose of a traceroute is to find the IP addresses of the routers or hops that a packet traverses as it goes from your system to a target host.
		- It is helpful as it indicated the amount of hops between your system and the target host
		- Tries to discover the routers across the path from your system to the target system.
		- There is no direct way to discover the path from your system to a target system.
			- Rely on ICMP to trick the routers into revealing their IP addresses
			- This can be accomplished by using a small Time to Live in the IP header field.
				- TTL indicated the maximum number of routers/hops that a packet can pass through before being dropped
	- ==telnet==
		- The TELNET (Teletype Network) protocol was developed in 1969 to communicate with a remote system via a CLI.
		- telnet uses the TELNET protocol for remote administration. 
			- default port is 23
		- From a security perspective, telnet sends all the data, including usernames and passwords, in clear text. 
		- Can use Telnet to connect to any service and grab its banner. 
		- Lets say we want to discover more information about a webserver listening on Port 80. 
			- We connect to port 80 and then we communicate using the HTTP protocol
			- use the command GET / HTTP/1.1
			- hit enter twice
	- ==netcat==
		- Supports both TCP and UDP protocols
		- Can function as a client that connects to a listening port
		- Can act as a server listening on a port of your choice
