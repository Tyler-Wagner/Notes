- ==Certificate Authorities==
	- Solved the problem of distributing encryption keys when you want to communicate securely with others or authenticate a message that you send to others.
		- When you want others to send confidential messages. you give them a public key to use to encrypt the message.
		- When you want to authenticate yourself you sign a hash of your message with your private key.
	- The basic problem:
		- There is no mechanism for establishing the owner's identity.
			- Shown in e-commerce
		- How can you be sure a shopping or banking service is really maintained by whom it claims
	- *Public Key Infrastructure* aims to prove that the owners of public keys are who they say they are.
		- Anyone issuing a public key should publish it in a digital certificate
		- Certificate is guaranteed by a *certificate authority (CA)*
	- PKI can use private or third party CA's
	- Private CA can be set up within an organization for internal communications
		- only be trusted within an organization
	- Functions of a third party CA
		- Provide a range of certificate services useful to the community of users
		- Ensure the validity of certificates and the identity of those applying for them
		- Establish trust in the CA with users, governments, regulatory authorities, and enterprises
		- Manage the servers that store and administer the certificates
		- Perform key and certificate lifecycle management
- ==Digital Certificates==
	- Essentially a wrapper for a subjects public key
	- Contains information about the subject and certificates issuer
	- Signed to prove that it was issued to the subject by a particular CA
		- Could be a human or a server
- ==Root of Trust==
	- Defines how users and different CAs can trust one another.
	- Each CA issues itself a certificate
		- Called the *root certificate*
			- Self signed
			- Uses RSA 2048 or 2096
			- Can be used to sign other certificates issued by the CA
	- **Single CA**
		- A single root CA issues certificates directly to users and computers
		- Often used on private networks
		- Problem:
			- Single CA server is exposed, if compromised the whole PKI collapses
	- **Third Party CA's**
		- Operate a hierarchical model
		- In hierarchical model:
			- the root CA issues certificates to one or more intermediate CAs
			- Intermediate CAs issue certificates to subjects
		- Has the advantage that different intermediate CAs can be set up with certificate policies, which enables users to perceive clearly what a particular certificate is for.
		- Each leaf certificate can be traced to the root CA
			- Also called *certificate chaining* or *chain of trust*
- ==Self-signed Certificates==
	- Any machine, web server or program code can be deployed with a *self signed certificate*
	- Self-signed certificates can also be useful in development test environments
	- OS or web browser will mark self-signed certificates as untrusted
		- Users can override this
	- Difficult to validate
	- Not used to protect critical hosts and applications
- ==Certificate Signing Requests==
