- People - employees, contractors, suppliers and customers - represent part of the attack surface of any organization.
- Referred to as the human vector.
- ==Human Vectors==
	- A prerequisite of many types of attacks is to obtain information about the network and security system.
	- Knowledge is not only stored on computer disks; it also exists in the minds of employees and contractors.
	- People operating computers and accounts are part of the attack surface.
	- *Social Engineering* refers to means of either eliciting information from someone or getting them to perform some action for the threat actor.
		- Can also be referred to as "hacking the human"
	- Threat actor might use social engineering to gather intelligence as recon in preparation for an intrusion or to effect an actual intrusion by obtaining account credentials or persuading the target to run malware.
	- Many diverse social engineering strategies of social engineering
		- A threat actor creates an executable file that prompts a network user for their password and then records whatever the user inputs. Attacker emails the executable file to the user with the story that the user must open the file and log organization has been experiencing that morning.
		- Threat actor contacts the help desk pretending to be a remote sales representative who needs assistance setting up remote access.
		- A threat actor triggers a fire alarm and then slips into the building during the confusion and attaches a monitoring device to a network port
- ==Impersonation and Pretexting==
	- *Impersonation* simply means pretending to be someone else.
		- One of the basic social engineering techniques
		- Possible when the target cannot verify the attackers identity easily
	- Threat actor will usually use one of the two approaches
		- **Persuasive/consensus/liking**
			- Convince the target that the request is a natural one that would be impolite or somehow "odd" to refuse
		- **Coercion/threat/urgency**
			- Intimidate the target with a bogus appeal to authority or penalty.
	- The classic impersonation attack is for the social engineer to phone into a department, claim they have to adjust something on the user's system remotely, and then get the user to reveal their password
	- The use of a carefully crafted story with convincing or intimidating details is called *pretexting*
	- Making an impersonation to either charm or intimidate a target usually depends on the attacker obtaining privileged information about the organization.
	- Some techniques are dedicated to obtaining this type of intelligence as a recon activity
	- Most companies are set up toward customer service rather than security
		- information is quite easy to come by
	- Any information an attacker can get can assist them in their attack
- ==Phishing and Pharming==
	- *Phishing* is a combination of social engineering and spoofing.
		- Persuades or tricks target into interacting with a malicious resource disguised as a trusted one.
	- A phishing message might try to convince the user to perform some action
	- Other types of phishing use a spoof website set up to imitate a bank or e-commerce site or some other web resource that should be trusted by the target.
	- When the user authenticates with the spoofed site, their login credentials are captured.
	- Phishing refers specifically to email or text message threat vectors
	- Other ways to perform phishing on other types of media are:
		- *Vishing*
			- A phishing attack conducted through a voice channel
			- Can be much more difficult for someone to refuse a request made in a phone call compared to one made in an email
		- *SMiShing*
			- Phishing attack that uses simple message service (SMS) text communications as the vector
	- Direct messages to a single contact have a high chance of failure.
		- Other types of phishing actually try to get multiple people to validate credentials
	- *Pharming* attack is one that redirects users from a legitimate website to a malicious one.
		- Pharming relies on corrupting the way the victims computer performs Internet name resolution so the person is being redirected from the right site to the malicious one.
- ==Typosquatting==
	- Means that the threat actors registers a domain name very similar to a real one.
		- Hopes a user will not notice the difference and assume they are browsing a trusted site or receiving an email from a trusted source.
	- Another technique is to register a hijacked subdomain using the primary domain of a trusted cloud provider.
- ==Business Email Compromise==
	- Refers to a sophisticated campaign that targets a specific individual within the company.
		- Typically is a executive or senior manager.
	- Threat actor is likely to perform recon to obtain a detailed understanding of the target and the best psychological approach and pretexts to trick them.
	- Threat actor might first try to gain control of a legitimate mail account to use to send the phishing messages.
	- **Brand Impersonation and Disinformation**
		- Brand Impersonation means the threat actor commits a resources to accurately duplicate a company's logo and formatting to make phishing messages or pharming website a visually compelling fake.
			- Could even fake the stye or tone of email communications
		- Disinformation refers to a purposeful motivation to deceive
			- Might attempt to get others to repeat or amplify the false facts.
			- Creates misinformation
		- Misinformation refers to repeating false claims or rumors without the intention to deceive.
	- **Watering Hole Attack**
		- Relies on a group of targets that use an unsecure third party website.
- ==Review==
	- The help desk takes a call, and the caller states that she cannot connect to the e-commerce website to check her order status. She would also like a username and password. The user gives a valid customer company name but is not listed as a contact in the customer database. The user does not know the correct company code or customer ID. This is likely to be a social engineering attempt, or is it a false alarm?
		- ==Social engineering attack==
	- A purchasing manager is browsing a list of products on a vendors website when a window opens claiming that antimalware software has detected several thousand files on their computer that are infected with viruses. Instructions in the official-looking window indicate the user should click a link to install software that will remove these infections. What type of social engineering attempt is this, or is it a false alarm?
		- ==Phishing, trying to have the user download some software==
	- Your CEO calls to request market research data immediately be forwarded to their personal email address. You recognize their voice, but a proper request form has not been filled out and use of third-party email is prohibited. They state that normally they would fill out the form and should not be an exception, but they urgently need the data to prepare for a roundtable at a conference they are attending. What type of social engineering techniques could this use, or is it a false alarm?
		- ==Brand Impersonation, Vishing, Impersonation and Pretexting==
	- A company policy states that any wire transfer above a certain value must be authorized by two employees, who must separately perform due diligence to verify invoice details. What specific type of social engineering is this or is this policy designed to mitigate?
		- ==Designed to mitigate==
