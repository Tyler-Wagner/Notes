	- Used to describe all of the means used to protect data from loss or leakage
- Hardware Security Module (HSM)
	- physical device that provides a secure environment for cryptographic operations such as the generation, management, storage, and protection of encryption keys
- Screened Subnet
	- Sectioned off perimeter network that is isolated from the internal network. 
	- Provides additional security from eternal threats by housing public facing resources
- Impossible Travel Indicator
	- Reflects the unrealistic geographical locations between two login events by the same user within a short period of time. 
	- Often shows the signs of credential compromise and unauthorized access
- Crossover error rate
	- Point at which the false acceptance rate (FAR) and the false rejection rate (FRR) are equal
