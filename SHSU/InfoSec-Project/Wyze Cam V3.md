- for some reason all cameras come shipped with baseline firmware and not the most up to date firmware
	- Gave us an earlier version of 4.3X.XX.XXXX
- All of the messages that are of any importance are encoded with and EC Diffie-Hellman, specifically 25519
	- Would take WAY too long for anyone's machine to break the key
	- Hash for the signature is also insanely good using 
		- ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256
- Ran an Nmap on the thing, nothing on the TCP side (yet) but the UDP is what we are interested in anyways
- **Bin Walking**
	- Unzipped the firmware from Wyze website
		- Binaries are being made with MACOS
			- Can tell because of the extraction of the zip folder
	- binwalk -t shows multiple file systems
		- Squashfs
			- has a shadow file
				- Password is salted and is using SHA-512
					- Thats not happening
