- ==**Reconnaissance**==
	- <u>Nmap</u>
		- Performed an Nmap scan on my phone at 9:11 PM on 3/9/24 to see what my phones ports were open to
			- Nothing came up on a service scan and it is saying that all ports are down
			- When performing the scan with the command "nmap 192.168.0.159 -sV -Pn" it returned the following
				- Port 49152 is open and the service is tcpwrapped
					- Opened because the app is just a webhook wrapped in an application format
				- Port 62078 is open and the service is tcpwrapped
					- Opened because the app is just a webhook wrapped in an application format
			- Even though the camera is communicating via UDP it is still showing up that is has TCP ports open
			- When attempting to load the webpage nothing came up with either port. 
			- Performed a UDP scan to see the service running on the open ports and it returned
				- Port 5353 is open|filtered and the service is zeroconf
					- Read further into
				- Port 8900 is open|filtered and the service is jmb-cds1
					- Read further into
		- Performed a scan on 192.168.0.78 while having it connected to a web interface.
			- Port scanning it returned that all TCP ports are in a refused connection state
			- UDP port scan returned 
				- 8899/udp  open|filtered ospf-lite
				- 51890/udp open|filtered unknown

				- 58798/udp open|filtered unknown
			- ospf-lite can be referenced in the link shown here
				- https://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=8899
		- Shockingly when you open the webpage more ports get added.
			- 58467
			- 58468
			- 58469
		- Communicates to the webservice with on those ports

-  ==**Possible attacks**== 
	- A DOS attack is sure to work to even block the packets going to the users device
	- Maybe a replay attack?
		- Edit the key it sends to the user and send it back to the camera and see what it does
