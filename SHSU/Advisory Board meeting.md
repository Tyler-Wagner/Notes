- **Networking**
	- Bad class for cyber security students
	- Dont go over how specific things work
		- DNS
		- DHCP
		- HTTP
			- GET
			- HEAD
			- POST
			- PUT
			- DELETE
			- CONNECT
			- OPTIONS
			- TRACE
			- PATCH
	- Really go over the TCP/IP stack
	- Never go over the OSINT model
	- Never go over Firewalls or how they operate
	- ==Solution==
		- Break the classes up
		- Have a cyber based one and a CS based one
		- Cyber should have Intro to networking 1 and 2
			- Network theory is a copy and paste of of Intro to computer networking
- **Whole of Cyber security**
	- Classes we take
		- Building blocks make no sense
			- Go from DF to Cyber
			- Forces the Senior level cyber classes to be taught as intro classes
			- Professors end up speeding through the material to get to teach what they want to teach
			- Different professors teach the classes differently
				- Example
					- Burris Crypto VS Karpoor Crypto
				- ==solution== 
					- Force a curriculum on the professors that they have to follow
					- Stop with the no student left behind mindset
						- Passing students who do not understand lowers the quality of the higher level courses
		- Move away from DF
			- Understand the cyber degree is much newer to the university
			- Move away from DF classes
				- Introduce DF Tools
					- Can be used to teach students DF and the process
				- DF 1 and 2 moved to IA 1 and 2
				- Do intro to pentest 1 and 2
					- I already do intro to pentest on the side and have many students come to it
				- Intro to hardening/blue teaming 1 and 2
				- Culminate this into a senior classes such as cyber warfare and infosec where we can do proper red vs blue
				- Introduce a way for Cyber students can focus mainly on the security side of software engineering for the class
					- Maybe have it where atleast 1 cyber student is in a group and their job is to make sure that the program is as secure as they can make it
				- Keep Programming 1 and 2 and DSA
					- Great classes for us
				- Look at other universities path
					- Would allow for brainstorming of ideas for creating proper cyber security classes
